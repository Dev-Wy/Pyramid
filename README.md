## Overview
- This is a simple Pyramid Generator that works with arrays, strings, functions, loops, if/else statements, and more. Manipulate the variables to change the pyramid's size and "bricks". You can even use the boolean to invert the pryamid.

## My Process
### Built with
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### What I learned
- This project refreshed my JavaScript knowledge and helped me connect how each part works it build on each other as the JS fills out. I like being able to easily adjust the design in JavaScript. I wanted to adapt the original JS to a document with HTML and CSS. I'm learning how to connect the JS to the HTML.

### Continued development
- I enjoyed adding the HTML and CSS. I ended up doing a lot more research than I expected to figureout how to link up my HTML and JS, but I learned so many solid lessons.
